# Financial Engineering Research Report Reproduction

### Before you read:
This repository focuses on reproducing financial engineering research reports from major Chinese investment banking (IB) firms using Python.

> **Note**: Since the specific algorithms used by each firm are not publicly disclosed, this project primarily focuses on achieving similar backtesting performance (drawdown) and RankIC compared to the original reports.


## Overview
This project aims to replicate financial research reports from top Chinese investment banks using Python. By leveraging data analysis, visualization, and financial modeling tools, I strive to reproduce complex reports with precision, ensuring insights are accessible to a broader audience. It is an educational initiative for those interested in quantitative finance, data science, and financial engineering.

Due to the lack of public disclosure of the exact algorithms used by these firms, our reproductions focus on achieving similar drawdown rates and RankIC values to those reported in the original research.

## Features
- **Data Collection & Processing**: Automated retrieval and processing of financial data from multiple sources.
- **Report Replication**: Python scripts to replicate reports covering various financial metrics and analyses.
- **Visualization**: Graphs and plots using libraries like `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for detailed report visuals.
- **Quantitative Analysis**: Mathematical models implemented using Python for accurate financial metrics.
- **Customization**: Modify the scripts to customize for specific research report formats or additional data sets.

## Installation
