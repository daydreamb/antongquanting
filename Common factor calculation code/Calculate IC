# **Calculate Information Coefficient (IC)**

This Python function calculates the **Information Coefficient (IC)** to evaluate the correlation between factor values and future stock returns over time.

## **Code Explanation**

```python
# Import necessary libraries for statistical modeling, data manipulation, and numerical operations.
import statsmodels.api as sm
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from tqdm import tqdm
import warnings
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Ignore warnings to keep the output clean.
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')

### **Function: Calculate_IC**

```python
def Calculate_IC(factor_df, chgpct_df, Pool_df):
    """
    Calculates the Information Coefficient (IC) and Information Ratio (ICIR).
    
    Parameters:
    - factor_df: DataFrame containing factor values of multiple stocks over time.
    - chgpct_df: DataFrame containing percentage changes (returns) of stocks.
    - Pool_df: DataFrame that specifies which stocks are included in the stock pool (where '是' means "yes").
    
    Returns:
    - IC_mean: Mean of the Information Coefficient.
    - IC_std: Standard deviation of the Information Coefficient.
    - ICIR: Information Coefficient Information Ratio.
    """

    # Extract the time index from factor_df to synchronize all data across the same time period.
    time_index = list(factor_df.index)
    
    # Ensure Pool_df and chgpct_df have the same time index as factor_df.
    Pool_df = Pool_df.loc[time_index, :]
    chgpct_df = chgpct_df.loc[time_index, :]
    
    # Initialize an empty DataFrame to store IC values for each time step.
    IC = pd.DataFrame(index=time_index, columns=['IC'])

    # Iterate over all time steps except the last one.
    for i in range(len(time_index)-1):
        # Filter the stocks that are part of the pool at the current time step (where Pool_df contains '是').
        stock_pool = Pool_df.iloc[i, :]
        stock_pool = stock_pool[stock_pool == '是'].index

        # Find the common stocks between the factor_df and the stock pool for the current time step.
        pool = list(set(stock_pool).intersection(set(factor_df.columns)))
        
        # Get the factor values and percentage changes for the selected stocks at the current and next time steps.
        factor = factor_df.loc[:, pool].iloc[i, :]
        chgpct = chgpct_df.loc[:, pool].iloc[i+1, :]
        
        # Fill any missing factor values with 0 to avoid issues during correlation calculation.
        factor.fillna(0, inplace=True)
        
        # Calculate the Pearson correlation between the factor values and future stock returns (IC).
        temp_ic = factor.corr(chgpct, method='pearson')
        
        # Store the calculated IC for the current time step in the IC DataFrame.
        IC.loc[time_index[i], 'IC'] = temp_ic

    # Remove any rows where IC could not be calculated (i.e., where values are NaN).
    IC = IC.dropna(axis=0, how='any')

    # Calculate the mean, standard deviation, and Information Ratio (ICIR) of the IC values.
    IC_mean = float(IC.mean())
    IC_std = float(IC.std())
    ICIR = IC_mean / IC_std

    # Return the computed statistics.
    return IC_mean, IC_std, ICIR
```

### **How It Works:**

1. **Data Synchronization:**
   - The function first ensures that all the input data (`factor_df`, `chgpct_df`, and `Pool_df`) are aligned by time using the same `time_index`.
   
2. **Iterating Over Time:**
   - For each time step (except the last one), the function selects the stocks that are part of the stock pool (`'是'` or "yes") and finds the corresponding factor values.
   
3. **Calculating Information Coefficient (IC):**
   - The function calculates the **Pearson correlation** between the factor values at the current time step and the stock returns at the next time step. This correlation is the IC, representing how well the factor predicts future returns.
   
4. **Cleaning Data:**
   - Rows with missing IC values (`NaN`) are dropped to ensure the results are reliable.
   
5. **Summary Statistics:**
   - Finally, the mean IC, its standard deviation, and the **Information Coefficient Information Ratio (ICIR)** are calculated and returned.
