# Calculate Information Coefficient (IC)

This Python function computes the **Information Coefficient (IC)**, which measures the correlation between a given factor and future stock returns, and derives its summary statistics like mean, standard deviation, and Information Coefficient Information Ratio (ICIR).

## **Code Overview**

### **Imports:**

```python
import statsmodels.api as sm
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from tqdm import tqdm
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
```

- `statsmodels`, `pandas`, and `numpy`: Used for statistical analysis, data manipulation, and numerical operations.
- `tqdm`: Used for progress bars (not used in this version of the code).
- `warnings`: Suppresses warnings for cleaner output.
- `LinearRegression`: Imported but not utilized in this specific function.

---

### **Function Definition:**

```python
def Calculate_IC(factor_df, chgpct_df, Pool_df):
```

This function calculates the **Information Coefficient (IC)**, which evaluates the correlation between a factor's values and stock returns.

- **Parameters:**
  - `factor_df`: DataFrame containing factor values for multiple stocks over time.
  - `chgpct_df`: DataFrame with percentage change (returns) of the stocks.
  - `Pool_df`: DataFrame indicating which stocks are in the pool at each time (where `'是'` indicates "yes").

---

### **Data Synchronization and Preparation:**

```python
    time_index = list(factor_df.index)
    Pool_df = Pool_df.loc[time_index, :]
    chgpct_df = chgpct_df.loc[time_index, :]
    IC = pd.DataFrame(index=time_index, columns=['IC'])
```

- `time_index`: Extracts the time index from `factor_df` to ensure all DataFrames are aligned.
- `IC`: Initializes an empty DataFrame to store the calculated IC values for each time step.

---

### **Iterating Over Time Steps:**

```python
    for i in range(len(time_index)-1):
        stock_pool = Pool_df.iloc[i, :]
        stock_pool = stock_pool[stock_pool == '是'].index
```

- **Stock Pool Filtering:** The loop iterates over the time index, excluding the last time point (as IC is calculated between each period and the next one). `stock_pool` filters stocks based on the pool availability (`'是'` means "yes").

---

### **Factor and Return Correlation Calculation:**

```python
        pool = list(set(stock_pool).intersection(set(factor_df.columns)))
        factor = factor_df.loc[:, pool].iloc[i, :]
        chgpct = chgpct_df.loc[:, pool].iloc[i+1, :]
        factor.fillna(0, inplace=True)
        temp_ic = factor.corr(chgpct, method='pearson')
        IC.loc[time_index[i], 'IC'] = temp_ic
```

- **Matching Stocks:** The pool contains only the stocks that are present in both the `stock_pool` and `factor_df`.
- **Factor and Change Selection:** For the selected stocks, `factor` holds the factor values at the current time, and `chgpct` holds the returns at the next time step.
- **Filling Missing Values:** Any missing factor values are filled with `0`.
- **Pearson Correlation:** `temp_ic` computes the Pearson correlation between factor values and future stock returns, representing the IC at the current time.
- **Storing IC:** The computed IC is saved into the `IC` DataFrame.

---

### **Clean-Up and Summary Statistics:**

```python
    IC = IC.dropna(axis=0, how='any')
    IC_mean = float(IC.mean())
    IC_std = float(IC.std())
    ICIR = IC_mean / IC_std
```

- **Remove `NaN` Values:** Drops rows with missing IC values.
- **Summary Statistics:**
  - `IC_mean`: The average IC over time.
  - `IC_std`: The standard deviation of IC.
  - `ICIR`: The Information Coefficient Information Ratio, calculated as the mean IC divided by its standard deviation.

---

### **Conclusion:**

This function calculates the Information Coefficient (IC) and provides additional insights such as the IC mean, standard deviation, and ICIR. These metrics help to assess the predictive power of a factor with respect to future stock returns.

## **Usage Example:**

```python
# Example DataFrames for factor values, returns, and stock pool
factor_df = pd.DataFrame(...)  # Populate with actual data
chgpct_df = pd.DataFrame(...)  # Populate with actual data
Pool_df = pd.DataFrame(...)    # Populate with actual data

# Call the function
Calculate_IC(factor_df, chgpct_df, Pool_df)
```
